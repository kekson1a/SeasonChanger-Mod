## A mod that lets you change seasons in ULTRAKILL

## _What are seasons?_
  - A season (or "seasonal event" as it's called in the game) is a holiday, that changes some things in ULTRAKILL. Usually, it's these things: "-- EARLY ACCESS --" label in the Main Menu changes to something like "-- HAPPY EASTER --", music in the Main Menu, and all creatures gain a special hat.

## Features
  - SeasonChanger can store the season you chose in a config file
    - This can be disabled by unchecking the "SAVE SEASON ON GAME RESTART" checkbox. 

## Mod usage
  - After installing SeasonChanger, open up the ULTARKILL developer console by pressing F8, then type "setdate". A menu titled "SET DATE" should pop up.
